1.Using for in loop

  const resumeData = {
                   "name": "Madhu Bala Kishore.E",
  "contact_info": {
    "email": "madhukishore132@gmail.com",
    "phone": "9952534386",
    "address": "1331A/62,Ravisankar Nagar Tirunelveli-627011"
  },
  "summary": "Experienced software engineer with a passion for building scalable and efficient web applications. Skilled in full-stack development, with expertise in JavaScript, Node.js, React, and MongoDB.",
  "education": [
    {
      "degree": "Bachelor of Science in Geo Informatics",
      "university": "Anna University",
      "location": "Thoothukudi, India",
      "graduation_year": "2022"
    }
  ],
  "work_experience": [
    {
      "position": "System Engineer",
      "company": "GESA",
      "location": "Chennai, India",
      "start_date": "January 2022",
      "end_date": "Present",
      "responsibilities": [
        "Led a team of developers in the successful implementation of a new microservices architecture, resulting in a 30% improvement in application performance.",
        "Developed RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express for seamless integration between frontend and backend systems.",
        "Collaborated with UI/UX designers to create responsive and user-friendly web interfaces using React."
      ]
    }
  ],
  "skills": [
    {
      "category": "Programming Languages",
      "list": ["JavaScript", "Python", "Java"]
    },
    {
      "category": "Web Development",
      "list": ["HTML5", "CSS3", "React.js", "Node.js", "Express.js"]
    },
    {
      "category": "Databases",
      "list": ["MongoDB", "MySQL", "PostgreSQL"]
    },
    {
      "category": "Tools & Technologies",
      "list": ["Git", "Docker", "Jenkins", "AWS"]
    }
  ]
};

for (const key in resumeData) {
  if (resumeData.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
    console.log(`${key}: ${JSON.stringify(resumeData[key])}`);
  }
}

2.Using for of loop (for arrays)

for (const experience of resumeData.work_experience) {
  console.log(`Position: ${experience.position}`);
  console.log(`Company: ${experience.company}`);
  console.log(`Location: ${experience.location}`);
  console.log(`Start Date: ${experience.start_date}`);
  console.log(`End Date: ${experience.end_date}`);
  console.log(`Responsibilities: ${experience.responsibilities.join('\n')}`);
}

3.Using forEach method (for arrays)

resumeData.education.forEach(education => {
  console.log(`Degree: ${education.degree}`);
  console.log(`University: ${education.university}`);
  console.log(`Location: ${education.location}`);
  console.log(`Graduation Year: ${education.graduation_year}`);
});
